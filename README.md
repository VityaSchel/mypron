# Videos Explorer

This is my first app made with [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/) and Rust. It allows you to browse popular website with adult content, supports search, and has Material Design made with MUI and React.

It also supports caching using fs module of Tauri and temporal downloading of .torrent files.

## ⚠️ APP IS FOR DEMONSTRATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY ⚠️

Do not use it for piracy and illegal copying of copyright material! Do not use it for any profit! You are only allowed to view the code and execute the app to see how it runs. Do not use it for actual browsing!!!

## Download
